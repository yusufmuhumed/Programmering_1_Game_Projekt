The global coffee shortage that brought the world to its knees has left humanity sluggish, uncoordinated, and unable to respond to crises.

Now, in this post-apocalyptic world, we are left to navigate the ruins of civilization and fight for survival against all odds. Scavenging for food, water, and other resources is a daily struggle, and danger lurks around every corner. Whether it's avoiding roving bands of marauders or fighting off mutated creatures, every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death.
